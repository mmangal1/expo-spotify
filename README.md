## Expo Web

Currently Expo Web support is **not production ready**, but if you want to see how this project looks on the web as a PWA (Progressive Web App)... using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and react-dom.

[PWA: Expo Spotify](https://expo-spotify.calebnance.now.sh) looks best on a mobile device, but not bad on desktop!

- Install/Re-install: `yarn`
